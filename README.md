# Challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

# Visualization

the map shows the outlines of the tectonic plates, along with all earthquakes in the past 30 days, using leaflet tile layers and open street/topo maps. It is interesting to see that the majority of earthquakes are along the edges of these plates. I predict that the interactions between these plates contribute to the prevalence of earthquakes in these areas.
